# 2DHouseGen-Godot

(*Last update: May 2021*)
Generator of 2D houses for Godot v3.3.3 (might work with Godot 3.4)

https://waters-top.itch.io/2d-house-generator - web version to generate houses without forking the
repository

### Features

Generate:

1) a suburb house

### About house generation

* **Each room in a house is accessible via stairs by 2x1 player (he won't hit his head on the
  ceiling)** Very rarely it is not true (only in the extreme cases, see below)
* Each room has its own type. Furniture spawns according to that type.

### Suburb house generation algorithm

*Not describing high house algorithm because it is very simple: stack floors on ech other and make
sre that rooms have different widths*
*This description should give some cues about what is happening. Comments are hints too. All random
operations have customizable bounds, like room width or number of rooms/floors*

1) Create 1st floor(*choose random width for rooms and choose random amount of rooms*), add doors
   between all rooms and on the sides of the floor
2) Create *i*-th floor which is not wider than previous
3) Connect *i*-th floor to the previous by stairs. If impossible, connect with a ladder
4) Add doors between rooms on *i*-th floor
5) Repeat 2-3 for all floors from 2 to n
6) Merge rooms together into 2x2 big room between 1st and 2nd floor or into 2x1 room in *i*-th
   and *i-1*-th floor.
7) Add windows for each side room except 1st floor with respect to big rooms merged on a previous
   step (these rooms might have larger windows)

### Code

Code has comments, it is possible to figure out what it does.

* Each structure class has stateDump function for debugging
* Create functions have params (e.g. number of houses in a city)
* There is a Player class, he can open doors
* Platforms are on the different Tilemap because of the ladders
* Room specific furniture's can be tweaked in Furniture.gd dictionaries
* All tilemap resources can be changed and will work perfectly with custom ones (if you provide the
  right names for the tiles or create your own dictionaries)
